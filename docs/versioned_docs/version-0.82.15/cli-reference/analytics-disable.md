Kurtosis has functionality to collect product analytics metrics so we can make data-driven product decisions. These metrics are [anonymized, obfuscated, and never given to third parties](../explanations/metrics-philosophy.md)).

Anonymous metrics collection is enabled by default, but you can turn it off by running:

```bash
kurtosis analytics disable
```
