The instructions in this guide will walk you through installing the latest version of Kurtosis. 

If you already have Kurtosis installed and you're looking to upgrade to latest, [see here][upgrade-guide].

If you're looking to install a historical version instead, [see here][install-historical-guide].

I. Install Docker
-----------------

1. If you don't already have Docker installed, follow the instructions [here][docker-install] to install the Docker application specific to your machine (e.g. Apple Intel, Apple M1, etc.)
1. Start Docker
1. Verify that Docker is running:
   ```bash
   docker image ls
   ```

II. Install the CLI
-------------------------

<Tabs groupId="install-methods">
<TabItem value="homebrew" label="brew (MacOS)">

```
brew install kurtosis-tech/tap/kurtosis-cli
```

:::info
Homebrew might warn you that your Xcode is outdated or missing entirely. [This is a Homebrew requirement](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation), and has nothing to do with Kurtosis (which ships as prebuilt binaries). 

To install or update your Xcode, run:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="apt" label="apt (Ubuntu)">

```bash
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/kurtosis-tech/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurtosis.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kurtosis-cli
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yum" label="yum (RHEL)">

```bash
echo '[kurtosis]
name=Kurtosis
baseurl=https://yum.fury.io/kurtosis-tech/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/kurtosis.repo
sudo yum install kurtosis-cli
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="other-linux" label="deb, rpm, and apk">

Download the appropriate artifact from [the release artifacts page][release-artifacts].

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

The Kurtosis CLI cannot be installed directly on Windows. Windows users are encouraged to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)][windows-susbsystem-for-linux] to use Kurtosis.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

III. Add tab completion
-----------------------------
[Kurtosis supports tab completion][installing-tab-completion], even for dynamic values like enclave names. We strongly recommend installing it for the best Kurtosis experience.

IV. Configure analytics
------------------------
By default, Kurtosis reports anonymized, obfuscated analytics which [we use only to improve the product][metrics-philosophy]. 

If you'd like to [disable analytics][analytics-disable], you can run:

```bash
kurtosis analytics disable
```

To read more about why and how we collect product analytics metrics, [go here][metrics-philosophy].

V. Run the quickstart
-----------------------------
If you're new to Kurtosis, the [quickstart][quickstart] is a great way to started using Kurtosis.
