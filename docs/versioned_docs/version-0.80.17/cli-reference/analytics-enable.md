Kurtosis has functionality to collect product analytics metrics so we can make data-driven product decisions. These metrics are [anonymized, obfuscated, and never given to third parties](../explanations/metrics-philosophy.md)).

If you previously disabled metrics collection, you can re-enable it via:

```bash
kurtosis analytics enable
```
