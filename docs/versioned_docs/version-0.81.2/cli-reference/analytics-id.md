In addition to log outputs and screenshots, [product analytics metrics](../explanations/metrics-philosophy.md) may be useful for our team when debugging issues and shipping fixes for bugs. 

If you so choose, you may share with us your metrics user ID when letting us know about issues or bugs (in our [Github](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/issues/new/choose) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rjkj8m5C)). Doing helps us debug issues, ship fixes quicker, and ultimately improve Kurtosis over time.

To print your metrics user ID, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis analytics id
```
