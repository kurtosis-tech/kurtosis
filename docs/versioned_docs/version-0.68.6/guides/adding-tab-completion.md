[The Kurtosis CLI](../reference/cli/cli.md) supports tab completion for `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish`. With tab completion installed, you will be able to:

- Tab-complete subcommands (e.g. typing `kurtosis` and pressing TAB will suggest subcommands)
- Tab-complete dynamic arguments, when possible (e.g. typing `kurtosis enclave inspect` and pressing TAB will try to complete with the current enclave IDs)

The process for installing tab completion is specific to each shell:

<details>
<summary>bash</summary>

1. Ensure you have Bash version >= 4.1
    1. Print your Bash version:
        ```bash
        echo $BASH_VERSION
        ```
    1. If your Bash version is less than 4.1, upgrade it:
        * On Mac, upgrade Mac via Homebrew:
            ```bash
            brew install bash
            ```
        * On Linux, [upgrade it via the package manager for your distro](https://www.configserverfirewall.com/linux-tutorials/update-bash-linux/)
1. Check if you have [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) installed:
    ```bash
    type _init_completion
    ```
1. If you get an error like `-bash: type: _init_completion: not found`, install Bash completion:
    * On Mac:
        1. Install the completion library:
            ```bash
            brew install bash-completion@2
            ```
        1. Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`:
            ```bash
            export BREW_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix)"
            [[ -r "${BREW_PREFIX}/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && source "${BREW_PREFIX}/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
            ```
        1. Reload your shell
        1. Verify that you now have the completion installed:
            ```bash
            type _init_completion
            ```
    * On Linux, install it using the package manager for your distro using [these installation instructions](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion#installation)
1. Skip this step if you are installing using Homebrew and have `bash-completion@2` installed. Otherwise, proceed to source the output of `kurtosis completion bash` in your Bash config file:
    * On Mac, add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` file:
        ```bash
        # Add Kurtosis tab-completion
        source <(kurtosis completion bash)
        ```
    * On Linux, add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:
        ```bash
        # Add Kurtosis tab-completion
        source <(kurtosis completion bash)
        ```
1. If you have an alias set up for Kurtosis, add completion for that as well (we'll assume the alias `kt` in the examples below):
    * On Mac, add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` file:
        ```bash
        # Add tab-completion to Kurtosis alias
        complete -F __start_kurtosis kt
        ```
    * On Linux, add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:
        ```bash
        # Add tab-completion to Kurtosis alias
        complete -F __start_kurtosis kt
        ```
1. Reload your shell

<details>
<summary>zsh</summary>

1. Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:
    ```zsh
    # Add Kurtosis tab-completion
    source <(kurtosis completion zsh)
    compdef _kurtosis kurtosis
    ```
1. If you have an alias set up for Kurtosis, add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file (we'll assume the alias `kt` in this example):
    ```zsh
    # Add tab-completion to Kurtosis alias
    compdef __start_kurtosis kt
    ```
1. Reload your shell
1. If you get an error like `complete:13: command not found: compdef`, add the following to the top of your `~/.zshrc` and reload your shell again:
    ```zsh
    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>fish</summary>

1. Add the following to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file:
    ```fish
    # Add Kurtosis tab-completion
    kurtosis completion fish | source
    ```
1. Reload your shell

manual installation

If necessary, tab completion can be installed manually in two steps as follows, by first generating the 
tab completion code (specific to the shell) and then sourcing that code into the shell. 

1. The code needed to enable tab completion can be generated by the `kurtosis` cli by
   running `kurtosis completion <SHELL>` command, e.g. for `bash`:
   ```
   kurtosis completion bash 
   ```

1. `source`ing the output of the command will enable tab-completion, and adding the `source`
   command to your shell config file will enable it across shell instances.
   ```
   # Add Kurtosis tab-completion to your shell config file
   source <(kurtosis completion bash)
   ```
