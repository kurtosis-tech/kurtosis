Kurtosis will work locally or over remote infrastructure. To determine the type of infrastructure your instance of Kurtosis is running on, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis cluster get
```

The clusters that Kurtosis can connect to are defined in your `kurtosis-config.yml` file, located at `/Users/<YOUR_USER>/Library/Application Support/kurtosis/kurtosis-config.yml` on MacOS. See [this guide](https://docs.kurtosis.com/k8s#iii-add-your-cluster-information-to-kurtosis-configyml) to learn more about how to add cluster information to your `kurtosis-config.yml` file.

Below is an example of what a valid `kurtosis-config.yml` file might look like with the clusters: `docker`, `minikube`, and `cloud`:
```yml
config-version: 2
should-send-metrics: true
kurtosis-clusters:
  docker:
    type: "docker"
  minikube:
    type: "kubernetes"
    config:
      kubernetes-cluster-name: "minikube"
      storage-class: "standard"
      enclave-size-in-megabytes: 10
  cloud:
    type: "kubernetes"
    config:
      kubernetes-cluster-name: "NAME-OF-YOUR-CLUSTER"
      storage-class: "standard"
      enclave-size-in-megabytes: 10
```

:::tip Storage Class
The Storage Class specified in the configuration above will be used for spinning up persistent volumes. Make sure you have the right
value in case you are using persistent directories.
