To print all enclaves (both stopped and running) inside of your Kurtosis engine, use:

```bash
kurtosis enclave ls
```

The enclave UUIDs and names that are printed will be used in enclave manipulation commands and are refered to as [resource identifiers](../concepts-reference/resource-identifier.md).
