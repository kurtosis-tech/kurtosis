Kurtosis has the ability to send product analytics metrics, enabling us to understand our users better so that we can improve the product over time. This capability is enabled by default. 

However, if you previously disabled the sending of product analytics metrics using `[kurtosis analytics disable](./analytics-disable.md)` and wish to re-enable this capability, run:

```bash
kurtosis analytics enable
```
