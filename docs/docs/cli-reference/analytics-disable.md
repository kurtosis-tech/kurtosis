Kurtosis has the ability to send product analytics metrics, enabling us to understand our users better so that we can improve the product over time. While this capability is enabled by default, you may choose to opt-out by running the following command:

```bash
kurtosis analytics disable
``` 

This data is private, anonymized, obfuscated, and can be opted-out from. To learn more, we encourage you to read more about our [metrics philosophy](../explanations/metrics-philosophy.md).
