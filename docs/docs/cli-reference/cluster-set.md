To set the cluster for your instance of Kurtosis, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis cluster set $NAME_OF_CLUSTER
```

Where the `$NAME_OF_CLUSTER` argument is the name of a Kurtosis cluster defined in your `kurtosis-config.yml` (located at `/Users/<YOUR_USER>/Library/Application Support/kurtosis/kurtosis-config.yml` on MacOS). See [this guide](https://docs.kurtosis.com/k8s#iii-add-your-cluster-information-to-kurtosis-configyml) to learn more about how to add cluster information to your `kurtosis-config.yml` file.

Below is an example of what a valid `kurtosis-config.yml` file might look like with the clusters: `docker`, `minikube`, and `cloud`:
```yml
config-version: 2
should-send-metrics: true
kurtosis-clusters:
  docker:
    type: "docker"
  minikube:
    type: "kubernetes"
    config:
      kubernetes-cluster-name: "minikube"
      storage-class: "standard"
      enclave-size-in-megabytes: 10
  cloud:
    type: "kubernetes"
    config:
      kubernetes-cluster-name: "NAME-OF-YOUR-CLUSTER"
      storage-class: "standard"
      enclave-size-in-megabytes: 10
```

:::tip Storage Class
The Storage Class specified in the configuration above will be used for spinning up persistent volumes. Make sure you have the right
value in case you are using persistent directories.
