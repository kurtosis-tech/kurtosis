The `clean` command is used to remove stopped enclaves and their contents to free up resources. If the `-a` flag is passed in, all running enclaves, their contents, and unused engine containers will be removed as well.

- Removes stopped enclaves and stopped engine containers
- Removes all services within stopped enclaves
- Removes all unused Kurtosis images (engine + logs aggregator + enclaves)
- Removes all files artifacts and all Docker volumes within stopped enclaves
```
  kurtosis clean [flags]
```
Flags:
1. The `a, --all` removes running enclaves as well
2. The `-h, --help` flag shows help for clean


NOTE: This will not stop the Kurtosis engine itself! To do so, use the [engine stop](./engine-stop.md) command.
