Kurtosis is a small startup, which means that understanding how users are using the product is vital to our success. To this end, we've built the capability for Kurtosis to send product analytics metrics.
We identify every user's machines with a hash value of the `unique machine id of most host OS's` which allow us to analyze the user experience flow.
You can enable and disable sending metrics analytics through this command

```bash
kurtosis analytics enable|disable
```
