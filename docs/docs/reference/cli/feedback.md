Your feedback is valuable and helps us improve Kurtosis. We thank you in advance for taking the time to share your suggestions and concerns with us.

To send our team feedback over email straight from the CLI, simply run:
```bash
kurtosis feedback "$YOUR_FEEDBACK"
```
where `$YOUR_FEEDBACK` is the feedback you would like to send to us. For example, `$YOUR_FEEDBACK` could be: "_I enjoy the enclave names_".

Running the above command will open a draft email using your default email client with the `TO:` line pre-filled with our feedback email list (feedback@kurtosistech.com) and the body of the message pre-filled with `$YOUR_FEEDBACK` (that you entered in the command line).

To quickly see all the ways you can get in touch with us, simply run:
```bash
kurtosis feedback
```
which will print out:
- The link to our [Github](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/issues/new/choose) for filing bug reports and feature requests as Github Issues.
- Our [feedback email address](mailto:feedback@kurtosistech.com) for sending us suggestions, comments, or questions about Kurtosis via email.
- A [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/d/zgt-f2c-66p/kurtosis-onboarding) to schedule a dedicated 1:1 onboarding session with us to help you get started.
