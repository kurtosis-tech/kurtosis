Interactions with Kurtosis happen via API. To facilitate interaction with Kurtosis, we provide [client libraries][kurtosis-client-libs] in Go and Typescript for interacting with the Kurtosis API. These can be used to, for example, write Kurtosis-based tests using your test framework of choice.

For language-specific guides and examples, see the READMEs for each of our client libraries:
- [Go guides and examples][golang-readme]
- [Typescript guides and examples][typescript-readme]

This page documents the objects and functions that are available in all client libraries.

StarlarkRunResponseLine
-----------------------

This is a union object representing a single line returned by Kurtosis' Starlark runner. All Starlark run endpoints will return a stream of this object.

Each line is one of:

### [StarlarkInstruction][starlarkinstruction] `instruction`
An instruction that is _about to be_ executed.

### [StarlarkInstructionResult][starlarkinstructionresult] `instructionResult`
The result of an instruction that was successfully executed

### [StarlarkError][starlarkerror] `error`
The error that was thrown running the Starlark code

### [StarlarkRunProgress][starlarkrunprogress] `progressInfo`
Regularly during the run of the code, Kurtosis Starlark engine will send progress information through the stream to account for progress that was made running the code.

### [StarlarkRunFinishedEvent][starlarkrunfinishedevent] `runFinishedEvent`
This object will be sent _once_ at the end of the execution to signify it has ended.

### [StarlarkWarning][starlarkwarning] `warning`
A warning, non-fatal, message

StarlarkInstruction
-------------------

`StarlarkInstruction` represents a Starlark instruction that is currently being executed. It contains the following fields:

* `instructionName`: the name of the instruction

* `instructionPosition`: the position of the instruction in the source code. It iscomposed of (filename, line number, column number)

* `arguments`: The list of arguments provided to this instruction. Each argument is composed of an optional name (if it was named in the source script) and its serialized value

* `executableInstruction`: A single string representing the instruction in valid Starlark code

StarlarkInstructionResult
-------------------------

`StarlarkInstructionResult` is the result of an instruction that was successfully run against Kurtosis engine. It is a single string field corresponding to the output of the instruction.

StarlarkError
-------------

Errors can be of three kind:

* Interpretation error: these errors happen before Kurtosis was able to execute the script. It typically means there's a syntax error in the provided Starlark code. The error message should point the users to where the code is incorrect.

* Validation error: these errors happen after interpretation was successful, but before the execution actually started in Kurtosis. Before starting the execution, Kurtosis runs some validation on the instructions that are about to be executed. The error message should contain more information on which instruction is incorrect.

* Execution error: these errors happen during the execution of the script against Kurtosis engine. More information is available in the error message.

StarlarkRunProgress
-------------------

`StarlarkRunProgress` accounts for progress that is made during a Starlark run. It contains three fields:

* `totalSteps`: The total number of steps for this run

* `currentStepNumber`: The number of the step that is currently being executed

* `currentStepInfo`: A string field with some information on the current step being executed.

StarlarkRunFinishedEvent
------------------------

`StarlarkRunFinishedEvent` is the object returned when the execution of the Starlark code is finished. Is composed of two fields:

* `isRunSuccessful`: whether the run successfully finished or not

* `serializedOutput`: when the run is successful and the Starlark code has returned an object, the returned object is automatically serialized to JSON by Kurtosis and returned via this field.

StarlarkWarning
---------------

`StarlarkWarning` is a warning message returned by Kurtosis Starlark engine. Warnings are by definition non-fatal, they typically point out an antipattern in the code or a deprecated feature still being used

StarlarkRunResult
-----------------

`StarlarkRunResult` is the object returned by the blocking functions to run Starlark code. It is similar to [StarlarkRunResponseLine][starlarkrunresponseline] except that it is not a union object:

* `instructions`: the [Starlark Instruction][starlarkinstruction] that were run

* `insterpretationError`: a potential Starlark Interpretation error (see [StarlarkError][starlarkerror]

* `validationErrors`: potential Starlark Validation errors (see [StarlarkError][starlarkerror]

* `executionError`: a potential Starlark Execution error (see [StarlarkError][starlarkerror]

* `runOutput`: The full output of the run, composed of the concatenated output for each instruction that was executed (separated by a newline)


StarlarkRunConfig
-----------------

This is a configuration object for Starlark Runs:

* `RelativePathToMainFile`: The relative filepath (relative to the package's root) to the main file, if not set will use the default value 'main.star'. Example: if your main file is located in a path like this `github.com/my-org/my-package/src/internal/my-file.star` you should set `src/internal/my-file.star` as the relative path. Configurable using `WithRelativePathToMainFile`
* `MainFunctionName`: The main function name, if not set will use the default value 'run'. Configurable using `WithMainFunctionName`
* `SerializedParams`: The parameters to pass to the package for the run. It should be a serialized JSON/YAML string. Configurable using `WithSerializedParams`; defaults to `{}` if not set.
* `DryRun`: When set to true, the Kurtosis instructions are not executed. Configurable using `WithDryRun`; defaults to false.
* `Parallelism`: The level of parallelism for instructions that support parallelism. Configurable using `WithParallelism`; defaults to 4
* `ExperimentalFeatureFlags`: List of experimental features to turn on for this run. Leave empty to leave any experimental feature disabled. Configurable using `WithExperimentalFeatureFlags`; defaults to empty

ServiceContext
--------------
This Kurtosis-provided class is the lowest-level representation of a service running inside a Docker container. It is your handle for retrieving container information and manipulating the container.

### `getServiceName() -> ServiceName`
Gets the Name that Kurtosis uses to identify the service.

**Returns**

The service's Name.

### `getServiceUuid() -> ServiceUUID`
Gets the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that Kurtosis creates and uses to identify the service.
The differences with the Name is that this one is created by Kurtosis, users can't specify it, and this never can be repeated, every new execution of the same service will have a new UUID

**Returns**

The service's UUID.

### `getPrivateIpAddress() -> String`
Gets the IP address where the service is reachable at from _inside_ the enclave that the container is running inside. This IP address is how other containers inside the enclave can connect to the service.

**Returns**

The service's private IP address.

### `getPrivatePorts() -> Map<PortID, PortSpec>`
Gets the ports that the service is reachable at from _inside_ the enclave that the container is running inside. These ports are how other containers inside the enclave can connect to the service.

**Returns**

The ports that the service is reachable at from inside the enclave, identified by the user-chosen port ID set in [`ServiceConfig.ports`](./starlark-reference/service-config.md) when the service was created.

### `getMaybePublicIpAddress() -> String`
If the service declared used ports in [`ServiceConfig.ports`](./starlark-reference/service-config.md), then this function returns the IP address where the service is reachable at from _outside_ the enclave that the container is running inside. This IP address is how clients on the host machine can connect to the service. If no used ports were declared, this will be empty.

**Returns**

The service's public IP address, or an empty value if the service didn't declare any used ports.

### `getPublicPorts() -> Map<PortID, PortSpec>`
Gets the ports that the service is reachable at from _outside_ the enclave that the container is running inside. These ports are how clients on the host machine can connect to the service. If the service didn't declare any used ports in [`ServiceConfig.ports`](./starlark-reference/service-config.md), this value will be an empty map.

**Returns**

The ports (if any) that the service is reachable at from outside the enclave, identified by the user-chosen ID set in [`ServiceConfig.ports`](./starlark-reference/service-config.md) when the service was created.

### `execCommand(List<String> command) -> (int exitCode, String logs)`
Uses [Docker exec](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/) functionality to execute a command inside the service's running Docker container.

**Args**

* `command`: The args of the command to execute in the container.

**Returns**

* `exitCode`: The exit code of the command.
* `logs`: The output of the run command, assuming a UTF-8 encoding. **NOTE:** Commands that output non-UTF-8 output will likely be garbled!
