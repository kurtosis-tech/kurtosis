The `ServiceConfig` is used to configure a service when it is added to an enclave (see [add_service][add-service-reference]).

```python
config = ServiceConfig(
    # The name of the container image that Kurtosis will use to create and start the service's container.
    # This image can be pulled from a remote container registry, picked up from the local cache, or built by Kurtosis using
    # the underlying container engine.
    # If a string is provided, Kurtosis will by default detect if images exists locally, or pull from container registry if not.
    # The string form is syntactic sugar for ImageSpec with only image set
    # ImageSpec referring to private registries limited to Docker
    # Reach out to the team if you want to run Kurtosis with private images on Kubernetes
    # If an ImageBuildSpec is provided, Kurtosis will build the image.
    # MANDATORY

Note that `ImageBuildSpec` can only be used in packages and not standalone scripts as it relies on build context in package. More info on [`ImageBuildSpec`](./image-build-spec.md) here.
More info can be found on [locators referring to local resources here][locators] and how to turn your script into a Kurtosis [package][package] here.

The `ports` dictionary argument accepts a key value pair, where `key` is a user defined unique port identifier and `value` is a [PortSpec][port-spec] object.

The `files` dictionary argument accepts a key value pair, where `key` is the path where the contents of the artifact will be mounted to and `value` is a [Directory][directory] object or files artifact name.
Using a `Directory` object with `artifact_name` is strictly equivalent to directly using the files artifact name as the value of the dictionary. This is just to simplify usage.

See [Nix Support][nix-support] for more information on how to use the Nix and Kurtosis together.

You can view more information on [configuring the `ReadyCondition` type here][ready-condition].

:::tip
If you are trying to use a more complex versions of `cmd` and are running into issues, we recommend using `cmd` in combination with `entrypoint`. You can
set the `entrypoint` to `["/bin/sh", "-c"]` and then set the `cmd` to the command as you would type it in your shell. For example, `cmd = ["echo foo | grep foo"]`
:::

:::tip Example of a rendered label
If you have defined the pod label key:value pair in `ServiceConfig` to be:

```py
config = ServiceConfig(
    ...
    labels = {
        "name": "alice",
	"age": "20",
	"height": "175"
    }
)
```

then the labels for the pods on Kubernetes will look like:
```
labels:
	kurtosistech.com.custom/name=alice
	kurtosistech.com.custom/age=20
	kurotsistech.com.custom/height=175
```

while on Docker, the container labels will look like:
```
labels:
	"com.kurtosistech.custom.name": "alice"
	"com.kurtosistech.custom.age": "20"
	"com.kurtosistech.custom.height": "175"
```
:::

The `user` field expects a [`User`][user] object being passed.

The `tolerations` field expects a list of [`Toleration`][toleration] objects being passed.
