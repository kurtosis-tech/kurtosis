This guide assumes that you have [Kurtosis installed](../get-started/installing-the-cli.md).

If you would like more information on Kubernetes and how to set up, run and manage a cluster check out these official [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/). 

Please note that in order to ensure Kurtosis works the same way over Kubernetes as it does over Docker locally, service names must be a valid [RFC-1035 Label Name](https://kubernetes.io/docs/advanced-concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#rfc-1035-label-names). This means service names must contain: at most 63 characters, only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-', start with an alphabetic character, and end with an alphanumeric character. 

I. Create a Kubernetes Cluster
-----------------

There are many different ways to get a Kubernetes cluster (roughly ordered easiest to hardest):

- Use [Kubernetes provided with Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/)
- Install [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)
- Use [k3s](https://k3s.io/)
- Deploy it on an onprem cluster and manage the machine provisioning yourself
- Deploy it on the cloud, managing the Kubernetes nodes on cloud instances yourself (e.g. EC2, AVM, GCE, etc)
- Deploy it on a managed Kuberenetes cluster, managing scaling and configurations yourself (e.g. EKS, AKS, GKE)

II. Add you Kubernetes Cluster credentials to your `kubeconfig`
-------------------------

This step will depend highly on how your cluster was created. But generally you will need to either:

- Manually edit the `kubeconfig` file to contain cluster and authentication data. For more information, see [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/).
- Use your cloud provider's CLI to automatically edit the `kubeconfig` file so that it contains your cluster and authentication data. For example, you if you are using Amazon's managed Kubernetes service (called EKS), [this tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html) is comprehensive.


III. Add your cluster information to `kurtosis-config.yml`
--------------------------------

1. Open the file located at `"$(kurtosis config path)"`. This should look like `/Users/<YOUR_USER>/Library/Application Support/kurtosis/kurtosis-config.yml` on MacOS.
2. Paste the following contents, changing `NAME-OF-YOUR-CLUSTER` and `STORAGE-CLASS-TO-USE` as per the cluster you created and save:
```yaml
config-version: 2
should-send-metrics: true
kurtosis-clusters:
  docker:
    type: "docker"
  minikube:
    type: "kubernetes"
    config:
      kubernetes-cluster-name: "minikube"
      storage-class: "standard"
      enclave-size-in-megabytes: 10
  cloud:
    type: "kubernetes"
    config:
      kubernetes-cluster-name: "NAME-OF-YOUR-CLUSTER"
      storage-class: "STORAGE-CLASS-TO-USE"
      enclave-size-in-megabytes: 10
```

:::tip Storage Class
The Storage Class specified in the configuration above will be used for spinning up persistent volumes. Make sure you have the right
value in case you are using persistent directories.
:::

We support storage classes that support dynamic provisioning; here are some of them:

1. For AWS we recommend the [`aws-ebs-csi-driver`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/blob/master/docs/install.md)
2. For DigitalOcean we recommend [`do-block-storage`](https://github.com/digitalocean/csi-digitalocean/?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-to-kubernetes) but your cluster should have this out of the box
3. K3s the default provisioner `local-path` should just work out of the box
4. For minikube the default provisioner `standard` should just work out of the box

For any other cloud setup please reach out to us by creating an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis)

IV. Configure Kurtosis
--------------------------------

1. Run `kurtosis cluster set cloud`.  This will start the engine remotely. See the CLI reference for more information about `kurtosis cluster` commands [here](../cli-reference/cluster-set.md).
1. *In another terminal*, run [`kurtosis gateway`](../cli-reference/gateway.md). This will act as a middle man between your computer's ports and your services deployed on Kubernetes ports and has to stay running as a separate process.

Done! Now you can run any Kurtosis command or package just like if you were doing it locally.

V. \[Optional] Activate the enclave pool to accelerate the enclave creation time
--------------------------------

This step is optional, but we recommend taking it as it improves the user experience during the enclave creation, specifically regarding speed.

Creating a new enclave from scratch demands several time-consuming engine tasks and the creation of resources.

The enclave pool feature was introduced to reduce the time it takes for a user to run a Kurtosis package in the cloud by spinning up the enclaves before they are needed.

The enclave pool is a functionality of the Kurtosis engine that automatically creates `idle` enclaves, when the engine is started, that are then used whenever users need to create a new enclave (e.g: when running the `kurtosis enclave add` command).

This mechanism reduces enclave creation time by using a running `idle` enclave when a new enclave is requested from the engine.

To enable this feature you have to run the following:

1. Run `kurtosis engine restart --enclave-pool-size {pool-size-number}`. If you already follow the previous step and replace the {pool-size-number} with an integer

OR

1. Run `kurtosis engine start --enclave-pool-size {pool-size-number}`. If the engine has not been started yet.
