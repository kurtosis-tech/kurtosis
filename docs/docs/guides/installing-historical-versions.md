Occasionally, using older versions of Kurtosis is necessary. For example, when working with a [Starlark](../advanced-concepts/starlark.md) Kurtosis package that was initially developed with an older version of Kurtosis, we might want rollback our Kurtosis version to ensure the version of Kurtosis we are running is compatible with the Kurtosis package.

The instructions in this guide will walk you through installing and using an older version of Kurtosis. To see what versions are available, reference our [changelog](../changelog.md).

If you're looking to install the latest version of Kurtosis, [see here][install-kurtosis].

:::tip
In order to upgrade Kurtosis to another version *after you've performed a downgrade (i.e. installed a historical version)*, you must first uninstall the version of Kurtosis you've installed and re-install Kurtosis. When using Homebrew, the workflow will be (replacing `HISTORICAL-VERSION` with the historical version you have installed):
1. `brew uninstall brew uninstall kurtosis-tech/tap/kurtosis-cli@HISTORICAL-VERSION`
2. `brew install kurtosis-tech/tap/kurtosis-cli` for upgrading to the latest version or `brew install kurtosis-tech/tap/kurtosis-cli@TARGET-VERSION` for upgrading to a specific version
3. `kurtosis engine restart`
