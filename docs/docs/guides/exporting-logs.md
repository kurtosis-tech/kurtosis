This guide assumes that you have [Kurtosis installed](../get-started/installing-the-cli.md).

Kurtosis comes with a logs aggregator component that aggregates logs from services across enclaves. This component uses
Vector under the hood. Logs aggregator can be configured independently for each cluster, in the Kurtosis [config file](../cli-reference/index.md#configuration-file-path).

Kurtosis uses the notion of "sinks" to describe the location where you want your logs exported. Sink configurations are
forwarded as-is (with some exceptions, see below) to Vector, therefore Kurtosis can export to all sinks that Vector supports. 
For a complete list of supported sinks, please refer [here](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/). Currently,
logs exporting only works with Docker.

The following guide walks you through the process of setting up a local Elasticsearch/Kibana instance to which Kurtosis
will forward logs to. We also include configuration examples for common sinks, such as AWS OpenSearch, S3, etc.

## Setting up Kurtosis

Before you proceed, make sure you have:
- [Installed and started the Docker engine](https://docs.kurtosis.com/next/install#i-install--start-docker) on your local machine
- [Installed the Kurtosis CLI](https://docs.kurtosis.com/next/install#ii-install-the-cli) (or upgraded it to the latest release, if you already have the CLI installed)

## Starting a local Elasticsearch/Kibana instance

Start an Elasticsearch container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name es01 --net bridge -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:8.17.3
```

Note, the network must be set to `bridge` for the logs aggregator to be able to connect to Elasticsearch.

Start a Kibana container with following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name kb --net bridge -p 5601:5601 kibana:8.17.3
```

Generate an Elasticsearch enrollment token with the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it es01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
```

Access Kibana at `http://localhost:5601` and paste the enrollment token generated by the command above. Subsequently, Kibana
will ask you for a 6-digit verification code. To view this code, access Kibana container logs:

```bash
docker logs kb
```

Next, Kibana will ask you to sign in. The username for the local Elasticsearch instance is `elastic`, and you can generate
the password with:

```bash
docker exec -it es01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
```

You have now successfully started an Elasticsearch instance.

## Configuring Kurtosis to send logs to Elasticsearch

Locate your Kurtosis configuration file with the following command:

```bash
kurtosis config path
```

Determine the IP address of your Elasticsearch container by running the following command:

```bash
docker inspect -f '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}' es01
```

Open the configuration file and paste the following content, replacing `<PASSWORD>` with the Elasticsearch password generated
in the previous section and `<ELASTICSEARCH_IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of your Elasticsearch container:

```yaml
config-version: 3
should-send-metrics: true
kurtosis-clusters:
  docker:
    type: "docker"
    logs-aggregator: 
      sinks: 
        elasticsearch:
          type: "elasticsearch"
          bulk: 
            index: "kt-{{ enclave_uuid }}-{{ service_name }}"
          auth:
            strategy: "basic"
            user: "elastic"
            password: "<PASSWORD>"
          tls:
            verify_certificate: false
          endpoints:
            - "https://<ELASTICSEARCH_IP_ADDRESS>:9200"
```
:::info
`config-version` must be set to 3 for logs aggregator configurations to apply
:::

:::danger
`tls.verify_certificate` should not be disabled outside of testing!
:::

Finally, restart Kurtosis engine to apply the changes:

```bash
kurtosis engine restart
```

## Verify logs delivery

To verify that Kurtosis are actually exporting logs to Elasticsearch, start by running a package. In this guide, we use
`ethpandaops/ethereum-package`:

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package
```

Once the package has finished execution, go to  `http://localhost:5601/app/enterprise_search/content/search_indices`.
Indices created by Kurtosis will the in the format `kt-{{ enclave_uuid }}-{{ service_name }}` (as configured above)

## Configuring other sinks

Kurtosis sinks configurations are one-to-one to Vector sink configurations, with the `inputs` field being injected automatically
by Kurtosis. It is not possible at the moment to specify a different input source. Please refer to the official Vector
[documentation](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/) for sink configurations.

Below are examples of some common configurations that serve as good starting points for your custom sink configurations.

### AWS OpenSearch Serverless

```yaml
config-version: 3
should-send-metrics: true
kurtosis-clusters:
  docker:
    type: "docker"
    logs-aggregator: 
      sinks: 
        elasticsearch:
          type: "elasticsearch"
          opensearch_service_type: "serverless"
          bulk: 
            index: "kt-{{ enclave_uuid }}-{{ service_name }}"
          aws:
            region: "<AWS_REGION>"
          auth:
            strategy: "aws"
            access_key_id: "<ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
            secret_access_key: "<SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
          endpoints:
            - "<OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT>"
```

### AWS CloudWatch

  docker:
    type: "docker"
    logs-aggregator:
      sinks:
        cloudwatch:
          type: "aws_cloudwatch_logs"
          region: "<AWS_REGION>"
          auth:
            access_key_id: "<ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
            secret_access_key: "<SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
          group_name: "<LOG_GROUP_NAME>"
          stream_name: "kt-{{ enclave_uuid }}-{{ service_name }}"
          encoding:
            codec: "json"
```

### AWS S3

  docker:
    type: "docker"

      sinks: 
        s3:
          type: "aws_s3"
          region: "<AWS_REGION>"
          auth:
            access_key_id: "<ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
            secret_access_key: "<SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
          bucket: "<BUCKET_NAME>"
          key_prefix: "kt-{{ enclave_uuid }}/{{ service_name }}/"
          encoding:
            codec: "json"
```
