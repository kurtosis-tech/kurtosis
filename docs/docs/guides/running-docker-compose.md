This guide assumes that you have [Kurtosis installed](../get-started/installing-the-cli.md) and a project with a `docker-compose.yml`, `compose.yml`, `docker_compose.yml` or `.yaml` equivalents.

:::info Experimental Feature
This is an experimental feature still under development and some Docker Compose setups are not yet supported. 
See below for list of features not yet supported in Kurtosis. If you'd like support for your Docker Compose setup, let us know on [Github](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/issues)!
:::

### 1. Setup Docker Compose project

Navigate to the root of your project with a `docker-compose.yml` or if the project is hosted on Github, grab the Github link where the Docker Compose exists. For this guide, we'll go off of the [`nextcloud-redis-mariadb`](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/blob/master/nextcloud-redis-mariadb/compose.yaml) compose in the [`awesome-compose`](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master) repo.

```
services:
  nc:
    image: nextcloud:apache
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - nc_data:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - redisnet
      - dbnet
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - MYSQL_HOST=db
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=nextcloud
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    restart: always
    networks:
      - redisnet
    expose:
      - 6379
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.5
    command: --transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --binlog-format=ROW
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - dbnet
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=nextcloud
    expose:
      - 3306
volumes:
  db_data:
  nc_data:
networks:
  dbnet:
  redisnet:
```

### 2. Run!

In the root of your project, run the following command:

```
kurtosis run .
```
OR using github link:
```
kurtosis run github.com/docker/awesome-compose/nextcloud-redis-mariadb
```

Behind the scenes, Kurtosis will interpret your Docker Compose setup as a Kurtosis [package](../get-started/basic-concepts.md#package) and convert it into [starlark](../advanced-concepts/starlark.md) that is executed on an [enclave](../get-started/basic-concepts.md#enclave). The output will look like this:

```bash
INFO[2024-01-25T13:56:29-05:00] Creating a new enclave for Starlark to run inside...
INFO[2024-01-25T13:56:33-05:00] Enclave 'blue-ravine' created successfully

Container images used in this run:

> mariadb:10.5 - locally built
> redis:alpine - locally cached

Service 'db' added with service UUID '7010d01344e34a7c9f061d4fa43e5e0d'

Service 'nc' added with service UUID 'c30843ea60b8459c8841565a11be5dde'

> add_service name="redis" config=ServiceConfig(image="redis:alpine", env_vars={})
Service 'redis' added with service UUID '26dceba158004fdcb8d5dba035a6c4dd'

Starlark code successfully run. No output was returned.

Congrats! You now have your Docker Compose setup running in Kurtosis. Run `kurtosis web` to view your environment in Kurtosis' GUI. Additionally, you can configure the Kurtosis engine to run over Kubernetes and run the same command to get your Docker Compose setup running in a K8s cluster. Check out this [guide](./running-in-k8s.md) on how to se tup Kurtosis over K8s!

### Notes on Docker Compose to Kurtosis conversion

- Named volumes are converted to a [Persistent Directory](../api-reference/starlark-reference/directory.md) in Kurtosis - a Kurtosis managed directory that persists on services through multiple runs
- Kurtosis handles creating an isolated network inside an enclave. If the `network` key specifies custom networks, the config is ignored, potentially altering network behavior in the environment
- Services names with a `_` must be renamed as Kurtosis naming follows [RFC-1035](../best-practices.md) standard
- Service level [`env_file`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/05-services/#env_file) key is not yet supported ([`environment`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#environment) is supported)
- [`secret`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/05-services/#secrets) key is not yet supported
- For`volumes`, absolute path mappings (e.g. `/opt/data:/var/lib/mysql`) are not supported as Kurtosis packages cannot reference files outside a Kurtosis package. You can move the contents inside the package and convert to a relative path so Kurtosis can access the files
- Referencing a service's name in a hostname elsewhere in the Docker Compose (e.g. `postgres://db:5431`) is not supported
- `reservations` for `cpus` and `memory` are supported, but other container level config such as `restart`, `limits`, etc. are not yet supported
