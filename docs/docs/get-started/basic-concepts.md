Package
-----------

A package defines the set up logic for a containerized backend. Packages can be accessed via Github locators.

```bash 
kurtosis run github.com/kurtosis-tech/basic-service-package
```

Packages can accept a set of parameters, defined by the package author, which enable the package consumer to modify their deployed backend at a high-level without needing to know how to configure each individual service.

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/kurtosis-tech/basic-service-package \
  '{"service_a_count": 2, 
    "service_b_count": 2, 
    "service_c_count": 1,
    "party_mode": true}'
```

Enclave
-----------

An enclave is a "walled garden" in which Kurtosis runs a containerized backend. Enclaves can run anywhere that you have a Docker engine or a Kubernetes cluster. The main purposes of an enclave are resource isolation and "garbage collection". With an "enclave remove" command (`kurtosis enclave rm`), you can destroy all of the resources used to set up your environment and leave nothing hanging around on your machine(s).

Plan
-----------

The "plan" is the series of instructions, encoded in a package, that runs in an enclave. Each instruction in a plan is a basic building block for spinning up a containerized backend. You can see the plan that a package will run by "dry-running" the package:

```bash
kurtosis run --dry-run github.com/kurtosis-tech/basic-service-package
```
