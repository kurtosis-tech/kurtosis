Introduction
------------

Welcome to the [Kurtosis][homepage] quickstart! This guide takes ~5 minutes and will walk you through how to use a Kurtosis package to spin up a distributed system over Docker. Specifically, you will use the [ethereum-package][ethereum-package] to bootstrap and start-up a private Ethereum testnet. 

Kurtosis is a platform for packaging and launching environments of containerized services and serve two types of users: the author of an environment definition, referred to as a [Kurtosis package][packages-reference], and the consumer or user of the environment definition. This quickstart is intended to put you in the shoes of the consumer - someone who needs a quick and easy way to get a production-like environment to develop and test changes quicker for your distributed system. A separate guide is [available here][how-to-set-up-postgres-guide] to introduce you to the world of Kurtosis package authoring and how one might define and build an environment with Kurtosis for themselves or for their team.

Our mission is to make building distributed systems as easy as building a single server application. The first problem we aim to solve on our journey to achieve this mission is to bridge the author-consumer divide for environment definitions. For this reason, we built Kurtosis. Further reading about what Kurtosis is and what problems Kurtosis aims to solve, is available on our [introduction page][homepage]. To learn more about our motivations behind starting Kurtosis, go [here][why-we-built-kurtosis-explanation].

This guide is in a "code along" format, which means you are expected to follow the code examples and run the Kurtosis CLI commands on your local machine. Everything you run in this guide is free, public, and does not contain any sensitive data. 

:::tip What You'll Do
1. Install Kurtosis and Docker, if you haven't already.
2. Configure how you want your distributed system to be spun up, using parameters that are passed in at runtime.
3. Run a single command to spin up your network.

If you ever get stuck, every Kurtosis command accepts a `-h` flag to print helptext. If that doesn't help, you can get in touch with us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jJFG7XBqcY) or on [Github](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/issues/new/choose)!

Install dependencies
--------------------
Before you get started, make sure you have:
* [Installed Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and ensure the Docker Daemon is running on your machine (e.g. open Docker Desktop). You can quickly check if Docker is running by running: `docker image ls` from your terminal to see all your Docker images.
* [Installed Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/#ii-install-the-cli) or [upgrade Kurtosis to the latest version](https://docs.kurtosis.com/upgrade). You can check if Kurtosis is running using the command: `kurtosis version`, which will print your current Kurtosis engine version and CLI version.

Define how your system should look like
---------------------------------------

Kurtosis environment definitions, referred to here on as [Kurtosis packages][packages-reference], support parameterization out of the box. This means your teams or your communities can leverage the same package with different configurations for their specific use-case, eliminating the need to maintain different Bash scripts or `docker-compose.yml` files per use of the environment definition.

You're now going to create a file to house the parameters that you will pass in at runtime when your system starts up. Check out the README for the [ethereum-package][ethereum-package] to see the full list of configuration options and flags available for use.

Create a file titled: `network_params.yaml` in your home directory, populate it with the below contents, and save your file:
```yaml
participants:
	- el_client_type: geth
		el_client_image: ethereum/client-go:latest
		el_client_log_level: ''
		el_extra_params: []
		cl_client_type: lighthouse
		cl_client_image: sigp/lighthouse:latest
		cl_client_log_level: ''
		beacon_extra_params: []
		validator_extra_params: []
		builder_network_params:
		count: 2
network_params:
  network_id: '3151908'
  deposit_contract_address: '0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242'
  seconds_per_slot: 12
  slots_per_epoch: 32
  num_validator_keys_per_node: 64
  preregistered_validator_keys_mnemonic: 'giant issue aisle success illegal bike spike
    question tent bar rely arctic volcano long crawl hungry vocal artwork sniff fantasy
    very lucky have athlete'
  deneb_for_epoch: 500
verifications_epoch_limit: 5
global_client_log_level: info
additional_services: []

```
The arrays in the `participant` object enables you to define the specific Ethereum client types and respective image tags you want to use in your network, alongside any extra parameters for the validator, beacon, or builder as well as some useful flags for the verbosity of log lines. In this example you'll be using the `latest` image tags for the Geth and Lighthouse clients and have specified `2` nodes to be spun up.

Meanwhile, the `network_params` object defines the specific parameters for the network, including traits like the `network_id`, `seconds_per_slot`, and `slots_per_epoch`. 

Lastly, there are a few fields that let you, as a consumer, define the log verbosity level and whether or not you'd like additional services and infrastructure to be spun up with your distributed system. In this example, you will not spin up extra monitoring tools (via the `launch_additional_service` field) or Proposer-Builder Seperation (PBS) infrastructure (via the `mev_type` field).

Spin up your system!
--------------------
Great! You're now ready to bring up your own network. Simply run:
```console
kurtosis run github.com/kurtosis-tech/ethereum-package --args-file ~/network_params.yaml --enclave eth-network
```

Kurtosis will then begin to spin up your private Ethereum testnet by interpreting the instructions in the Kurtosis package, validating the plan to ensure there are no conflicts or obvious errors, and then finally executes the plan (read more about multi-phase runs [here][multi-phase-runs-reference]). Kurtosis first spins up an isolated, ephemeral environment on your machine called an [enclave][enclaves-reference] where all the services and [files artifacts][files-artifacts-reference] for your system will reside in. Then, those services will be bootstrapped and required files generated to start up the system.

You will see a stream of text get printed in your terminal as Kurtosis begins to generate genesis files, configure the Ethereum nodes, launch a Grafana and Prometheus instance, and bootstrap the network together. In ~2 minutes, you should see the following output at the end:

```console

```

Thats it! You now have a full, private Ethereum blockchain on your local machine.

The first section that gets printed contains some basic metadata about the enclave that was spun up. This includes the name of the enclave `eth-network`, its [Resource Idenfitier](https://docs.kurtosis.com/concepts-reference/resource-identifier/), your enclave's status, and the time it was created.

Next, you'll see a section dedicated to [Files Artifacts](https://docs.kurtosis.com/concepts-reference/files-artifacts/), which are Kurtosis' first-class representation of data inside your enclave, stored as compressed TGZ files. You'll notice there are configuration files for the nodes, grafana, and prometheus as well as private keys for pre-funded accounts and genesis-related data. These files artifacts were generated and used by Kurtosis to start the network and abstracts away the complexities and overhead that come with generating validator keys and getting genesis and node config files produced and mounted to the right containers yourself.

Lastly, there is a section called `User Services` which display the number of services (running in Docker containers) that make up your network. You will notice that there are 2 Ethereum nodes comprised of 3 services each (an EL client, a CL beacon client, and a CL validator client) and 2 genesis data generators for each the CL and EL. Each of these services are running in Docker containers inside your local enclave & Kurtosis has automatically mapped each container port to your machine's ephemeral ports for seamless interaction with the services running in your enclave.

Why Kurtosis packages - from a consumer's perspective
-----------------------------------------------------
Kurtosis was built to make building distributed systems as easy as building a single server app. Kurtosis aims to achieve this by bridging the environment definition author-consumer divide. Tactically, this means making it dead simple for a consumer (like yourself) to pick up an environment definition, spin it up, and deploy it the way you want, where you want - all without needing to know specialized knowledge about how the system works or how to use Kubernetes or Docker. 

Specifically, this guide showed you:
- ***The power of parameterizability***: as a consumer of the environment definition, having both the knowledge and means to configure the system to spin up the way you need it is incredibly valuable - a big reason why Kurtosis packages are meant to be parameterized. In this guide, you created the `network_params.yaml` file which contained your preferences for how the network should look and passed them in to Kurtosis with relative ease. The author of the package need only define the arguments and flags available for a consumer, and Kurtosis handles the rest once those are passed in at runtime.
- ***Portable and easy to wield***: a major contributor to the author-consumer divide comes from the knowledge gap between the author and consumer regarding the infrastruture and tools needed to instantiate a system. Understanding how Kubernetes works, what Bash script to use at which step, and working with Docker primitivies are all pain points we believe Kurtosis alleviates. In this guide, you installed Kurtosis and ran a single command to get your system up and running. This same command will work anywhere, over Docker or on Kubernetes, locally or on remote infrastructure. We believe this portability and ease of use are requirements for bridging the author-consumer divide.

There are many other reasons why we believe Kurtosis is the right tool for bridging the author-consumer divide. Check out the [next guide][how-to-set-up-postgres-guide] to experience the workflow for a package author and how Kurtosis improves the developer experience for an environment definition author.

Conclusion
----------
And that's it - you've successfully used Kurtosis to instantiate a full, private Ethereum testnet - one of the most complex distributed systems in todays time.

Let's review. In this tutorial you have:

1. Installed Kurtosis and Docker.
2. Configure how your system should look like, using parameters that are passed in at runtime.
3. Run a single command to spin up your network.
4. Reviewed how package consumers benefit from using environment definitions written for Kurtosis.

:::tip
In this short guide, you went through the workflow that a Kurtosis package consumer would experience. It is strongly encouraged that you check out the [next guide][how-to-set-up-postgres-guide] where you will set up a Postgres database and an API server to as a package author.

This was still just an introduction to Kurtosis. To dig deeper, visit other sections of our docs where you can read about [what Kurtosis is][homepage], understand the [architecture][architecture-explanation], and hear our [inspiration for starting Kurtosis][why-we-built-kurtosis-explanation]. 

To learn more about how Kurtosis is used, we encourage you to check out our [`awesome-kurtosis` repository][awesome-kurtosis-repo], where you will find real-world examples of Kurtosis in action, including:
- How to run a simple [Go test][go-test-example] or [Typescript test][ts-test-example] against the app we just built
- The [Ethereum package][ethereum-package], used by the Ethereum Foundation, which can be used to set up local testnets 
- A parameterized package for standing up an [n-node Cassandra cluster with Grafana and Prometheus][cassandra-package-example] out-of-the-box
- The [NEAR package][near-package] for local dApp development in the NEAR ecosystem

Finally, we'd love to hear from you. Please don't hesitate to share with us what went well, and what didn't, using `kurtosis feedback` to file an issue in our [Github](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/issues/new/choose) or to [chat with our cofounder, Kevin](https://calendly.com/d/zgt-f2c-66p/kurtosis-onboarding).
